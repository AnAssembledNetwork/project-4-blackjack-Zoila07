For this last project i coded a game of blackjack, its very simple code and game. First you would have to 
say how many players there will be so it can assign the correct amount of cards than it will start off with 
player 1 and randomly give you 2 cards, it will ask you whether you would like to hit or stand. I you choose hit 
it will give you another card and so on and if you choose stanbd then its no longer your turn and now the next person.
